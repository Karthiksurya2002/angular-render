    <!-- FULL VERSION -->
    <p>
      This Patient Care Management System is designed and developed entirely by
      <strong>Karthik</strong> as an individual project. The main objective of
      this project is to provide a simple and user-friendly platform where
      patients can book appointments, track their requests, and view medical
      reports online.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project focuses on reducing manual work in healthcare services and
      improving accessibility through digital solutions. By using modern web
      technologies, the system ensures smooth navigation, organized data
      handling, and an improved user experience.

    <p>
      This project reflects my skills in frontend development, application
      design, and problem-solving, with a strong focus on real-world healthcare
      needs and patient convenience.
